Q) Should we merge with .application? or have a .entrypoint (maybe together with CLI)

Q) CliArgumentMirror???
   CliArgumentMirror extends EntryPointMirror
   or EntryPointMirror->CliArgument
   I think EntryPointMirror is best, otherwise we have
   EntryPointMirror->CliArgument og CliArgument->EntryPointMirror

   No matter what we should not have 2 entry point mirrors for an actual entry point.
   So EntryPoinyExtension must support methods for registrating an extended entry point
   mirror
