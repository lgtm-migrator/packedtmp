/**
 * A special {@link Factory} type that takes a single dependency as input and uses a {@link Function} to dynamically provide new instances. The input
 * to the function being the single dependency.
 * <p>
 * Is typically used like this:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 *   InjectorBuilder builder = new InjectorBuilder();
 *   builder.bind(new Factory1<>(System::currentTimeMillis).setDescription("Startup Time"){};}
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * You can also use annotations on the dependency's type parameter. For example, say you have a {@link Qualifier} that
 * can read system properties, you can use something like this:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 *   InjectorBuilder builder = new InjectorBuilder();
 *   builder.bind(new FunctionFactory<@SystemProperty("threads") Integer, ExecutorService>(t -> Executors.newFixedThreadPool(t)){});}
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * You can also depend on a InjectionSite to get greater detail about the client requesting the service. For example,
 * there we return a different logger to each component that requests a logger, based on the components full path. For
 * example, if a component with the path {@code /jobs/MyJob} requests a logger, a logger with the name
 * {@code jobs.MyJob} is returned. If it is not a component that requests the logger, an anonymous logger is returned.
