/**
 * Typically used together with component scanning to indicate that a class should be installed.

 * <code>@Inject</code> annotations on the constructor or method that must have dependencies injected. However, in some
 * situations an annotation can be used for providing greater control over how dependencies are being injected.
 * <p>
 * One such example is if a dependency should only be injected if it is available. Injecting {@code null} instead of
 * throwing an {@link InjectionException}.
